Open the visual studio and create a new project.

Once you create, select which language are you gonna use, the directory name and location. I may choose C++ format with win32 console application.

the next step will be either using windows application or console application. In oop244, I may use console application and uncheck precompiled header but empty project.

in the source files, add new item and choose c++ file. Name it as .cpp after whatever so that C++ compiler possibly reads.

write the codes and compile it.
