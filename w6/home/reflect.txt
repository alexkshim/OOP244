1)	Explain why the copy assignment operator checks for self-assignment before doing anything else.
-Because there is no need to initialize anything to the same thing. If the object(parameter) and constructor has the same value, it should not copy the object(parameter).

2)	Explain why a class that uses dynamic memory to hold its resources needs custom definitions of its copy constructor and its copy assignment operator.
-Because you don't know how much memory this will allocate and it has to store the value over and over if required.

3)	How did you avoid duplication of code?
-Normally, I can use a function that holds validatity checking and reuse it to whatever needed.

4)	List what you have learned in completing this workshop
-How to use operators with dynamically allocated memory.
