1)	What is the size of each C-style character string that stores a name for the account? Why?
- 

2)	Using examples from your own code explain which features of object orien-tation you used.
- 

3)	Your class declares two member functions named set(...).  In C, this would generate an error.  Explain why this is allowed in C++.
- C does not know what is the difference of the functions if the functions' names are the same. But C++ knows it if the number of parameters are different.

4)	How do you ensure that the balance/refund displays to 2 decimal places?
- I will regard this as meaning of only the refund due. I included "#include <iomanip>" and used "<< fixed << setprecision(2) <<" in the cout to print two decimal points. The method was quite hard to figure out.

5)	What do you need to check before storing data for a tax year?
- I should check if m_years is equal to zero.

6)	What have you learned during this workshop?
- How to use public and private members of a class usefully. This was its big picture.
